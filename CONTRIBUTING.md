# Contributing to AI Chat Exporter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AI Chat Exporter! We welcome bug reports, feature suggestions, and code contributions.

## Getting Started

1. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/Covai-Labs/ai-chat-exporter/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Covai-Labs/ai-chat-exporter/pulls) before submitting new ones to avoid duplicates.
2. For local setup, prerequisites, build steps, and codebase architecture, refer to the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Submitting Pull Requests

Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure your changes pass all local verification checks:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm test
```

Please keep Pull Requests focused on a single bug fix or feature, and provide descriptive commit messages.

## Adding or Fixing a Platform Parser

All platform parsers (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.) live in the shared **[decant-core](https://github.com/Covai-Labs/decant-core)** library, not in this repository.

If an AI platform changes its DOM or you want to add support for a new platform, please open your PR there. See [decant-core's CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/Covai-Labs/decant-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for parser contribution guidelines, selector resilience rules, and test fixture instructions.
